# Problem Solving Patterns 


### Frequency Counter

- uses objects or sets to collect values/ frequencies of values

- this can ofter avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays / strings


### Multiple Pointers

- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on certain condition

- very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

### Sliding Window

- creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another

- Depending on certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)

- Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/ string etc.


### Divide and Conquer 

- This patter involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

- This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity 

- example: binary search
