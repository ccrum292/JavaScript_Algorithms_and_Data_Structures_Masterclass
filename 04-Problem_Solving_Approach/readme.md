# Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects


## Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is

- Devise a plan to solve algorithms 

- Compare an contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer 


## General 

- What is an Algorithm?
  - a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

- How do you improve?
  - Devise a plan for solving problems
  - Master common problem solving patters 

## Problem Solving

1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break it Down
4. Solve/ Simplify 
5. Look Back and Refactor 


### Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?


### Explore Concrete Examples 

- coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better

- start with simple examples

- progress to more complex examples

- explore examples with empty input


### Break it Down

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.


### Solve/ Simplify

- or... solve a simpler problem
  - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do 
  - Temporarily ignore that difficulty 
  - Write a simplified solution 
  - Then incorporate that difficulty back in


### Look Back and Refactor 

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the results differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?


## Recap

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it Down
- Solve/ Simplify 
- Look Back and Refactor
